# Road Accident Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to uncover patterns and insights that could potentially improve road safety measures. The dataset includes details of various road accidents over time, including accident locations, weather conditions, vehicle types, and more. By using SQL for data cleaning and Power BI for visualization, the project provides an interactive dashboard to make the findings easy to interpret.

## Project Goals:
- Analyze accident data to identify trends and accident hotspots.
- Investigate correlations between weather conditions, time of day, and accident frequency.
- Create a dynamic Power BI dashboard to visualize the results interactively.

## Tools & Technologies:
- **SQL/Python**: Used for data cleaning and manipulation. Queries were written to clean the dataset, handle missing data, and extract key insights.
- **Power BI**: Used for creating an interactive dashboard to visualize the data in an easy-to-understand format. Key metrics such as accident counts, accident severity, and locations were highlighted.

## Data Cleaning Steps:
- Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and ensured consistent data formatting.
- Filtered the dataset for relevant columns, like accident location, time, and weather conditions.
- Calculated additional features like accident severity and time of day to enhance the analysis.

## Key Insights:
- **Accident Hotspots**: Identified regions with the highest accident rates.
- **Peak Accident Times**: Analyzed time-of-day trends to uncover peak hours for accidents.
- **Weather Conditions**: Explored how different weather conditions affected accident frequency.

## Power BI Dashboard:
The dashboard showcases the following visualizations:
- Heatmap of accident hotspots.
- Accident counts by time of day.
- Weather-related accident frequency.
- Interactive filters to explore the data in real time.

## Future Improvements:
- Incorporate machine learning to predict accident likelihood based on weather, time, and location.
- Create a more detailed report on accident causes and contributing factors.

## Conclusion:
This project helped me deepen my understanding of data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. It also provided valuable insights into how data can help improve road safety initiatives.

Feel free to explore the project and suggest any improvements or contribute to it!
